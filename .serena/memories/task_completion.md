# Task Completion Guidelines

## Before Task Completion
1. **Test the changes**:
   - Run `npm start` to verify app starts without errors
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Test the new functionality manually
   - Verify responsive design on different screen sizes

2. **Code Quality Checks**:
   - Run ESLint: `npx eslint src/` 
   - Format code: `npx prettier --write src/`
   - Check for unused imports
   - Ensure proper prop-types are defined

3. **Integration Verification**:
   - Check that new routes are properly added to `src/routes.js`
   - Verify navigation works from sidebar
   - Test with existing Material Dashboard components
   - Ensure MUI theme consistency

## After Implementation  
1. **Documentation**:
   - Update relevant README sections if needed
   - Add inline comments for complex logic
   - Document any new dependencies

2. **File Organization**:
   - Ensure proper file structure follows project conventions
   - Keep components in appropriate directories
   - Use consistent naming patterns

3. **Performance**:
   - Check bundle size impact
   - Verify no memory leaks in React DevTools
   - Test loading performance
