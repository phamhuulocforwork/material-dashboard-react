Project uses Create React App conventions with ESLint (react-app) and Prettier. Components follow PascalCase filenames. Many components leverage MUI `sx` styling and maintain BEM-free classless styling. PropTypes are common though no TypeScript. Prefer functional components with hooks. MD-prefixed components wrap MUI primitives. Localization strings currently Vietnamese in user management modules. Stick with double quotes within JS files matching existing style.
